This package contains ellipse drawing routines designed for pairwise
confidence regions, including distorted ellipses for nonlinear
regression regions.  It also includes a routine `plotcorr()` for 
plotting correlation matrices using ellipses.

The examples require the `MASS`, `nls` and `ts` packages.
